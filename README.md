## 1. Implemented Models

| Model            | Status | Description |
|------------------|--------|-------------|
| **HarDNet**       | ✅     | Implementation based on [HarDNet: A Low Memory Traffic Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00948) – an efficient CNN inspired by DenseNet, optimized for speed and memory. |
| **HarDNet-MSEG**  | ✅     | Based on [HarDNet-MSEG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07172) – a multi-scale enhanced segmentation model combining HarDNet with pyramid strategies. |
| **HarDNet-CPS**   | ⏳     | Referenced from [HarDNet with CPS in medical imaging](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809423003865) – still in progress. |
| **FMPN**          | ⏳     | Based on [Feature Modulation Pyramid Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08788) – a model aimed at improving segmentation by enhancing multi-level features. |
| **ResEmoteNet**   | ✅     | Implementation of [ResEmoteNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10545) – a CNN tailored for facial expression and emotion recognition. |

## 2. TODO

- Finish **HarDNet-CPS** and **FMPN** implementations
- Explore alternative backends like **TensorFlow** and **TinyGrad**
- Possibly add model training configs and evaluation scripts
